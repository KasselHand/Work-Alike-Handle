    Kassel Hand Project Work-Alike-Handle Model README
    
    This model of the Kassel Hand is a sturdier version of the Lookalike model with
    a handle attached so someone without limb loss or limb difference on their 
    right side can interact with the model. Happy printing!

        a.) link to GCode

        b.) General Print Settings
            i.) We used an Anycubic Kobra 3 with the Anycubic Slicer.
           ii.) 2 Vertical Shells, 4 Horizontal Shells with a minimum thickness of 
                of 0.6mm
          iii.) 15% infill density, grid pattern
           iv.) 0.16mm layer height
            v.) Organic supports with a 0.28mm Z contact distance and 2.5mm spacing.
           vi.) Top and bottom interface layers should be 3 layers thick.
          vii.) Print the paddle (M-11) oriented where the flat of the paddle is 
                normal to the plate and the rod is parallel. While this may seem 
                like the worst orientation to print, the goal is to have tha layer 
                lines run along the rod and for the presence of unbroken layers 
                circumnavigating the entire rod and paddle. This is for maximum 
                strength.
                    1.) If you are using this as a display model, then you can 
                        print it with the thin rod on the plate with the paddle 
                        pointed up, like a letter "L" rotated backwards 90 degrees.
         viii.) 2mm brim with a 0.25mm brim separation gap.
           ix.) Print the gauntlet bottom, "S-01," vertically, where the region the 
                where the region the fingers would be pointed up and the wirst of 
                the gauntlet is touching the plate. The top of the gauntlet, "S-
                03," should be horizontalm with one side of the handle touching the 
                plate. This is for the best resulting strength where the highest 
                loading occurs.
            x.) Print the rest of the mechanism parts, those with file names 
                starting with "M-##" with their flattest end on the plate. This 
                includes all fingers: M-07, M-08, M-09, and M-10.
           xi.) M-13 and M-14, the axles, can be printed horizontally. The rod 
                rests length-wise along the plate.
          xii.) M-15 is an exception to Part viii. For best results, we have found 
                printing with the loop parallel to the plate is best.
         xiii.) M-16 should be printed with the loop flat on the plate as you would 
                expect a ring to sit atop a table.
    
    2.) File Naming Convention--"L-##-[Name of Part]-#X"
        a.) First, "L" is a letter. The letter in this spot is represented by an M 
            or S in the files. "M" represents Mechanism while "S" represents Shell.
            i.) Shell is printed out of gray and is a structural part.
           ii.) Mechanism is any movable part that is integral to the actuation.
        b.) The next section, a two-digit indicator, identifies the part.
        c.) The name of the part is the colloquial term for the part--it's easier 
            to identify if you need a new ring finger than a replacement, "M-03."
        d.) #X is how many copies are needed.
